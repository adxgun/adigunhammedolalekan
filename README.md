### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hammed, a Software Engineer based in the UK, I specialize in designing and building of scalable backend systems. My expertise includes Golang, JVM languages, Typescript, SQL and non-SQL databases and cloud-native technologies.

I worked as a backend engineer at [Vega](https://vega.investments), developing an OS for private wealth management using Java22, Typescript, Docker, and Kubernetes to create efficient, robust platforms.

Before that, I worked at [Goldman Sachs International in London](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), where I developed high-quality CRM tools for global Investment Bankers using Java, Python, AWS, and cloud technologies for scalable, modern systems.

I also enjoy side projects and have previously worked on projects like

- [csail.sh](https://www.github.com/adigunhammedolalekan/csail.sh) - a simple way to deploy and scale docker containers in a kubernetes cluster.
- [registry-auth](https://github.com/adigunhammedolalekan/registry-auth) - a library to aid in implementing authentication and authorization system for private docker registries.
- And, [more](https://github.com/adigunhammedolalekan?tab=repositories).

I also write at [Hammed Adigun's Blog](https://lekan.wtf/)

When I am not at work or hacking something on my computer, I love playing football, listening to music(Afrobeats and Burna boy) and exploring new restaurants :stuck_out_tongue:
