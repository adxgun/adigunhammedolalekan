### Hi there 👋

I'm Hammed, a Software Engineer currently living and working in London. I specialize in designing and building scalable backend systems. And, I love working with Linux containers, and cloud-native technologies.

I currently work at Goldman Sachs International in London, where I am helping to build high quality customer relationship management tools for Goldman's Investment Bankers throughout the continent. Using Java, Python, AWS and cloud-native techs.

Prior to that, I led a team of engineers in an effort to build a digital bank at [Roava](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roava). Using Go, Pulsar, google-cloud and cloud-native techs. 

I love hacking on projects on the side. In the past, I've worked on projects like 
* [csail.sh](https://www.github.com/adigunhammedolalekan/csail.sh) - a simple way to deploy and scale docker containers in a kubernetes cluster. 
* [registry-auth](https://github.com/adigunhammedolalekan/registry-auth) - a library to aid in implementing authentication and authorization system for private docker registries.

* And, [more](https://github.com/adigunhammedolalekan).

I also write at [Hammed Adigun's Blog](https://lekan.wtf)

When I am not at work or hacking something on my computer, I love playing football and, exploring new restaurants :stuck_out_tongue:
